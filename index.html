            <p class="p">The Akan people are an ethnic group that lives primarily in modern-day Ghana and Ivory Coast. The name Akan actually refers to the language of the Akan clan. Delving into their language, we see that they have a unique naming system derived from their culture. The first name a new-born child is given, "A day name", is usually given corresponding to the day of the week that they were born as shown below. These names come in two sets with one for male children and another for female children assigned to a specific day of the week. </p>
            <p class="p">This page contains an application that one can enter their date of birth and from it get what their Akan name would be had they been born into the Akan tribe. Lets spread the Akan culture one person at a time! </p>
